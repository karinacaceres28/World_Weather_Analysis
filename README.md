# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of the project was to improve the PlanMyTrip app. Using the weather description data obtained from the module, we will have beta testers filter the data using input statements to obtain their weather preferences. This will allow a list potential travel destination and nearby hotels. Beta testers will also have the chance to choose four potential cities from the list and create a travel itinerary. By using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the cities will be created and a marker layer map.
